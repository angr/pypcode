 Welcome to SLEIGH

 The SLEIGH library can be built by invoking the following
 from within the "src" directory.

    make libsla.a

 or the debug target, libsla_dbg.a, can be built.


 The SLEIGH compiler can be built with:

    make sleigh_opt

 or the debug target, sleigh_dbg, can be built instead.


 A tiny example application is provided in the source file
 "sleighexample.cc" in the root directory.  It demonstrates
 disassembly, pcode translation, and emulation using the SLEIGH
 library. It can be built with:

    make sleighexample

 The "sleighexample" application expects a the x86 specification
 file, named "x86.sla", to be in the "specfiles" directory.
 Or, you can easily change the hard coded string in main.

 The "sleighexample" application contains a tiny example of how to derive
 a tailored LoadImage class in order to get executable bytes to the SLEIGH
 translator and your application.  A more sophisticated example that wraps
 GNU's Binary File Descriptor library (libbfd) is available in the files
 "loadimage_bfd.hh" and "loadimage_bfd.cc"
